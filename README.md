## Coding Standards

- [ ] Code should be clean and well formatted.
- [ ] Use Prettier for code formatting (use the hotkey `alt+shift+f)

### Naming Conventions

- [ ] Classes/Types should always start with a capital letter
- [ ] Variables/attributes should always start with a lower case letter
- [ ] Private variables should start with an underscore "_"

## Code Organisation

- [ ] Implementations of Patterns should be in their own folder (E.g. iterator patterns for customers should be in its own folder)
- [ ] Use Packages in Visual paradigm to separate the different patterns so that the Over aring UMl does not get too large

## Documentation

- [ ] Add a Markdown README for all the different folders/UMLs that you make explaining what it does and what the different implementations do

## Useful Resources

- [ ] Watch all the videos on this channel [CodeAesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic/videos)
