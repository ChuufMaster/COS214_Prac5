## Coding Standards

- [ ] Code should be clean and well formatted.
- [ ] Use the Prettier extension for code formatting (use the hotkey `alt+shift+f` to quickly format your code)
- [ ] In the videos down below is explained how to use if statements as gaurd clauses to make code readable
  - [ ] E.g. test if anything you are using is null at the top of the method then after the if statement the code you want to run should be outside of the if statement and not in an else statement

### Naming Conventions

- [ ] Classes/Types should always start with a capital letter
- [ ] Variables/attributes should always start with a lower case letter
- [ ] Private variables should start with an underscore "_"

## Code Organisation

- [ ] Implementations of Patterns should be in their own folder (E.g. iterator patterns for customers should be in its own folder)
- [ ] Use Packages in Visual paradigm to separate the different patterns so that the Over aring UMl does not get too large
- [ ] Always add any new folders to [Folders](#folders) and a short description of what the folder contains and what it is supposed to do

## Documentation

- [ ] Add a Markdown README for all the different folders/UMLs that you make explaining what it does and what the different implementations do

## Useful Resources

- [ ] Watch all the videos on this channel [CodeAesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic/videos)
- [ ] GitHub Desktop should be used for commiting to the main
- [ ] Do some research on how branching works for version control
- [ ] Install markdown lint extension for vscode to make sure that the proper formatting for readme files is maintained
- [ ] Install cSpell extension for vscode for spelling highlighting

## Folders

### Example
