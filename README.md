## Coding Standards

- [ ] Code should be clean and well formatted.
- [ ] Use the Prettier extension for code formatting (use the hotkey `alt+shift+f` to quickly format your code)
- [ ] In the videos down below is explained how to use if statements as guard clauses to make code readable
  - [ ] E.g. test if anything you are using is null at the top of the method then after the if statement the code you want to run should be outside of the if statement and not in an else statement

### Naming Conventions

- [ ] Classes/Types should always start with a capital letter
- [ ] Variables/attributes should always start with a lower case letter
- [ ] Private variables should start with an underscore "_"

## Code Organisation

- [ ] Implementations of Patterns should be in their own folder (E.g. iterator patterns for customers should be in its own folder)
- [ ] Use Packages in Visual paradigm to separate the different patterns so that the Over aring UMl does not get too large
- [ ] Always add any new folders to [Folders](#folders) and a short description of what the folder contains and what it is supposed to do

## Documentation

- [ ] Add a Markdown README for all the different folders/UMLs that you make explaining what it does and what the different implementations do

## Useful Resources

- [ ] Watch all the videos on this channel [CodeAesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic/videos)
- [ ] GitHub Desktop should be used for committing to the main
- [ ] Do some research on how branching works for version control
- [ ] Install markdown lint extension for vscode to make sure that the proper formatting for readme files is maintained
- [ ] Install cSpell extension for vscode for spelling highlighting
- [ ] Install the GitLens extension to see who worked on what

## Library usage

- [ ] We are using RayLib for the GUI

## Git Usage

- [ ] Whenever pushing to a branch or to the main, make sure to add descriptive summaries of what you did and what you changed to make sure that it is easy to track what changes we have made
- [ ] Make sure that you do not work on the same parts of the project as someone else at the same time if you are not sure who is working on what just ask
- [ ] To make sure that you are the only one working on a specific part of the project add a comment with your name at the top of the file/s that you are working on and then remove your comments when you are done, alternatively you can also send a message in the discord when you start working on something and when you are done
- [ ] If all else fails and you aren't sure about something just ask on the group

## Folders

### Example

- [ ] This is an example of a sub heading for a folder
